    - **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** (for C/C++ programming)
    - **Eclipse IDE for JavaScript and Web Developers** (for web development using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS)

    If you're unsure, **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** is a safe choice for general use.

2. Select the appropriate version and click on **Install**.

        - **Variable name**: `JAVA_HOME`
        - **Variable value**: Path to the JDK folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-XX.X.X`).
    - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the **Path** variable under **System variables**.
